# Python/Flask

This directory contains a skeleton API project written in Python using Flask.

The project is set up to use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies.  
To get started, [install Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) and run the command `poetry install` in this directory.

> [!TIP]
> Poetry is entirely optional. Feel free to manage your dependencies in another way.

Run `flask --app app run` to start the API.
